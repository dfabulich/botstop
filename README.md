botstop
=======

This fork fixes BotStop to work for "Approval" mode.

To install, download https://github.com/dfabulich/botstop/archive/master.zip

Extract it. Inside the botstop-master folder will be a BotStop folder. Move that folder to your Vanilla /plugins directory. (If you have an existing copy of BotStop, delete it first.)
